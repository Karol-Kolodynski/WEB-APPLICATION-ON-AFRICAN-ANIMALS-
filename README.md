The  aim of  the engineering thesis is to create a web application about African animals, 
using technologies such as: „HTML”, „CSS” and „PHP”. The application contains a page with 
entries about African animals. One can enter the name of the animal, a description, the type of 
species concerned, a photo and the weight. It is also possible to comment on entries and to 
explore a map of African, on which the territories of individual animals are marked. The ad
ministration page has a functionality whereby the administrator has full rights to edit all entries 
and to delete them. At the same time, he has full control over users. The engineering work 
focuses on identifying new animals and connecting users of the site who want to learn about 
African animal species.
